# Profile made from React!

## Description

This is a portfolio that was made in React! It is a single page web app that is made to look like it has multiple pages on it. There are 4 "pages" and they are: About ME, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume. The about me is exactly what it sounds like, just a shot description of who I am. Portfolio has 6 projects that I have done during my time in this Bootcamp. Contact me is just a form to ask me any questions, and Resume has a short list of proficiencies from the front end and the back end of things.
